This Saucer War repo contains the game Saucer War which I wrote using the Python programming language. I used the Pygame library for this project. This game is reminiscent of the 80's video game Space Invaders, but uses flying saucers instead of a block of aliens moving down the screen.

As the game currently stands it is playable, but still has a ways to go before it is polished and complete. Some additional features include:
	* Add highscores section to diplay highscores
	* Add Save Game feature
	* Improve the levels at level > 17
	* Improve text display (Scores, Lives, ...) on screen

To run the game you must have Python 3 installed on your machine. Double-Click on SaucerWarApp.py to play the game.

I highly recommend the website http://www.programarcadegames.com/ to learn how to program arcade style games using Python and Pygame. This website was a valuable resource for me in programming this game.
